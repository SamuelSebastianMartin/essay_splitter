To conclude, cultural differences can be regarded as one of the important factors affecting international relations; but in essence, the wealth desires of countries or international organisations stimulate their economic expansion, that is, cultural and religious economic factors are only secondary to national interests. Culture is, in a certain sense, a political and economic reflection of a particular society (Robison, 1981). Therefore, in international relations, culture as a ‘soft power’ cannot function solely, it always relies on the ‘hard power’ brought about by the development of economic factors.
