In the modern world, international relations usually refer to the sum of all kinds of social relations across national boundaries, that is, competition, conflicts and cooperation between countries and international organisations in political, economic, military, cultural and other aspects (Wendt, 1987). Among them, varying degrees of the importance of different influencing factors have aroused extensive discussion (East and Gregg, 1967). This essay aims to demonstrate that cultural differences do affect the development of modern international relations to a certain extent, but economic factors are the most decisive and fundamental elements in the process of constructing the international relations between societies. The whole content will be divided into two parts. The first part will focus on the conflict between radical Islamic civilisation and Western civilisation in order to introduce the rationality of Huntington's theory of ‘Clash of Civilisations’, and then elaborate on three one-sided blunders of this viewpoint. The second part will demonstrate that compared to ‘culture’, economic factors are playing a far more important role in international affairs of both the Cold War and the Post-Cold War world.
